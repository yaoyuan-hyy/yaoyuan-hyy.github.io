I am a dedicated and forward-thinking Computer Science student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), on track to graduate in 2026. My academic and research interests are centered on pushing the boundaries of Deep Learning, with a specific focus on developing efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and applying Data Analytics to solve complex, real-world problems.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between theoretical AI research and its practical, impactful applications. I am particularly fascinated by the challenge of enhancing reasoning capabilities in lightweight models, making advanced AI more accessible and efficient.

## Education

**B.Sc. in Computer Science** | *The Chinese University of Hong Kong* (Sep 2021 - Aug 2026 Expected)
*   **Major:** Computer Science
