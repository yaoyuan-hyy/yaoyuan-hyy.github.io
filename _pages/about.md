I am Yaoyuan Hu (胡耀原), an final year undergraduate student Computer Science student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Now I am doing my final year project supervised by [Prof. Songtao Lu](https://songtaogithub.github.io/).

My academic and research interests include formal mathematics reasoning, AI4Math.

## Research Experience

**Undergraduate Researcher** | *The Chinese University of Hong Kong* (May 2025 - Aug 2025)
*   **Project:** Natural Language and Formal Language Reasoning Enhancement for Lightweight Model.
*   Developed **FormalMath-Cross**, a novel framework that empowers a 1.5B-parameter model to perform automated theorem proving in the Lean4 formal system.
*   Engineered a dual-stage fine-tuning pipeline: first adapting a base model to Lean4 syntax, then aligning natural language reasoning with formal proofs.
*   Achieved a **21.3% formal proof accuracy** on the MiniF2F benchmark (vs. 0% baseline) while reducing the number of candidate proofs required by 4x compared to larger 7B models.

## Awards & Leadership

*   **Wong Lee Sau Ying Memorial Scholarship** (2023/2024): Awarded for outstanding academic performance and significant contribution to the college community.
*   **Engineering Leadership, Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship (ELITE) Stream:** Selected as a member for this prestigious program, undertaking additional challenging coursework and extracurricular activities.
